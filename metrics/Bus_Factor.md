# {Bus Factor}

Question: What is the number of team members that if run over by a bus would put the project at risk?

## Description
Bus Factor shows how essential someone is to a software and if the software team is communicating effectively. A low bus factor represents a single point of failure and should be avoided, a higher bus factor is better. Any software that is critical to an organization should have a high bus factor.

## Objectives
Somebody should want to measure this factor to ensure that the software will not come to a halt anytime soon incase of an unseen circumstance. If they do find that the factor is too low then they should do whatever they can to increase it since large numbers are preferable. 

## Implementation
There are multiple things you can do the increase the bus factor of a software. You could ensure that all developers at least have access to all parts of code within a system. You could also do pair programming which allows knowledge of the code and how to software works to be shared among all members of a team.

### Filters (optional)
Include a Filter

### Tools Providing the Metric (optional)
Metric must be currently deployed/available, in contrast to a tool having the "potential" to provide the metric. Provide direct link to implementation/documentation, if applicable

### Data Collection Strategies (Optional)
If there are several different ways to collect data for this metric, list them here.
This may include expressing a metric in different ways.
